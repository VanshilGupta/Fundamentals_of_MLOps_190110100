AIOps stands for Artificial Intelligence for IT operations. It allows machines to solve the IT issues themseleves.It also caters to the exponential growth of data by automating the entire operations and creating a platform for the ML models to corelate the data points
independently.
Both MLOps and AIOps are used to automate the processes involve in the idea to production of an IT model for the end user usage. MLOps bridges the gap between model building and deployment of it which includes preparation of dataset, training and testing of ML model and serving it for the practical use while AIOps focuses on detecing and resolving the issues of a model in real time using AI independently without the manual human assistance.
