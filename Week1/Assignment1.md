*Problem 1
What is AIOps? How it is different from MLOps?*

AIOps stands for Artificial Intelligence for IT operations. It allows machines to solve the IT issues themseleves.It also caters to the exponential growth of data by automating the entire operations and creating a platform for the ML models to corelate the data points
independently.
Both MLOps and AIOps are used to automate the processes involve in the idea to production of an IT model for the end user usage. MLOps bridges the gap between model building and deployment of it which includes preparation of dataset, training and testing of ML model and serving it for the practical use while AIOps focuses on detecing and resolving the issues of a model in real time using AI independently without the manual human assistance.

*Problem 2 .
Explain what it means for a linear regression model to be interpretable.*

A linear regression model is interpretable as the outcome is dependent upon the linear combinatin of the feautres affecting it. It doesn't involve the correlation of the two features and hence the interpretation of the model is much easier. Each feature affects the predicted outcome via weight assigned to it. A unit change in the numerical feature will bring the difference equal to its weight in the prediction. It is clear that if a feature has assigned larger weight, it is affecting the prediction more. For eg considering the number of bikes rented on a particular day based on certain conditions of that day, if the day is rainy/stormy the number of bikes rented would be significantly lower.This is also supported by the regression model which has a large negative weight for the day being rainy/stormy hence the model is interpretable.
